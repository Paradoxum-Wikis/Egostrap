# Egostrap

A clone of Bootstrap that is used on ALTERPEDIA, part of the ALTER EGO Wiki.

The compiled CSS file will get transferred automatically to the wiki.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Paradoxum-Wikis/Egostrap.git
   cd Egostrap
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

I personally recommend installing Sass as global, but you do you.

## Testing

You can compile the SCSS by doing ```npm run build```.

With the compiled file, you can then go into your browser's style editor and replace the current Egostrap with your version.
